# Sequencing Graphs

Node-like tree which describes the structure

## 

* State Machines
* Component Connectivity

## 

# Building blocks in Architectural Synthesis

Functional Resources
Memory Resources
Interface Resources

## Constraints

* Interface constraints - e.g. format and timing of I/O data transfers
* Implementation constraints - e.g. area and latency

---

# Scheduling 

Planning when each operation will run
