> Note the (-) sign next to G\[1\]. Evaluates to g\[0\] (-) g\[1\]

## 4-point DFT

![](/uploads/snipaste_2022-06-30_22-10-50.jpg)

\--> A 4 point DFT can be represented as two sets of 2-point FFTs and a third one

## n-point DFT structure

![](/uploads/snipaste_2022-06-30_22-18-35.jpg)  
Sum of the even samples, plus the sum of the odd samples scaled by a value  
aka function of the even terms plus the scaled sum of the odd terms

> In the above, we split the algorithm into two functions so that we can perform operations in parallel

# 8-point FFT

![](/uploads/snipaste_2022-06-30_22-23-45.jpg)

* Perform separate 4-point FFTs on the even and odd values
  * And as such, each 4-point FFT has two 2-point FFTs

## On Bit-Reversal

# How many calculations?

Each butterfly operation takes 3 calculations (multiply, addition, subtract).  
So in n log n operations, there are 3n log n calculation.

Note that there are more steps to each multiplication (i.e. calculation of real and imaginary values)

...

> How many stages does a 64-point FFT have?

Two 32-point, each having two 16-point, each having two 8-point, etc...  
There are 6 stages (i.e. 2^6)

> What index does g\[37\] have in a 64-point FFT?

dec(37) = bin(100101)

0b101001 = 41

> How many butterfly operations are there per stage in a 64-point FFT

There are N/2 operations on each stage -> so there are 32 butterfly operations in a 64-point FFT

***

# Cooley-Tukey FFT

Since each butterfly operation is independent of the other operations in the same stage, we can (theoretically) perform all operations (there are `n/2` of them) per stage.  
The task interval can then be `1` (note whilst it may take several clock cycles to complete e.g. the computations), the time between stages is really just 1

Theoretically a 1024-point FFT running at 250MHz could then operate at 1024 points * 4 bytes per point * 2 values \[real, imaginary\] * (250 * 10^6) = 2 TB/s ... We probably don't have the power requirements, nor resources to achieve it. Also ðŸ”¥ðŸ¤’

That FFT operation, if having a task interval of 1, would be processing 1024/2 * 250 * 10^6 = 128 gigops/s

Only feasible to parallelise a small set of samples

# Software Implementation

![](/uploads/snipaste_2022-06-30_22-50-39_upd.jpg)

Firstly, we perform a bit-reversal on the inputs to set them up in the right order

Then after, stage loop (`log_2 size` times)  
\* Butterfly loop  
\* Inside each loop, compute all butterflies which use the same twiddle factor

## Reverse Bits

```cpp
// reverse the bits of input integer
unsigned int reverse_bits(unsigned int input) {
  int i, rev = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < M; i++) {
    rev = (rev << 1) | (input & 1);
    input = input >> 1;
  }
  return rev;
}
```

Note: When unrolling, synthesis can detect that these wires are just being remapped, and just rewire it

```cpp
void bit_reverse(DTYPE X_R[SIZE], DTYPE X_I[SIZE]) {
  unsigned int reversed;
  unsigned int i;

  DTYPE temp;
  for (i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
    reversed = reverse_bits(i); // Find the bit-reversed index

    if (i <= reversed) {
      // Swap the real values
      temp = X_R[i];
      X_R[i] = X_R[reversed];
      X_R[reversed] = temp;
      
      // Swap the imaginary values
      temp = X_I[i];
      X_I[i] = X_I[reversed];
      X_I[reversed] = temp;
    }
  }
}
```

* `if (i <= reversed) {...`
  * Only need to reverse once; so effectively, just do `SIZE/2` switches?
* Could pipeline the real and imaginary arrays
